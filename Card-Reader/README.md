Each card reader controller is responsible for a single card reader, usually associated with a secure door. Users come up to the card readers and scan their cards/badges - this causes the card reader to scan the 16 character sequence encoded into that user's card, which is then sent to the overseer via TCP. The card reader is not responsible for checking authorisation or for operating doors - these tasks are left to the overseer.
