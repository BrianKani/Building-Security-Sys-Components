/*
 * Fire Alarm Unit - Safety-Critical Software
 * ------------------------------------------
 *
 * Description:
 * This program, 'firealarm,' implements a safety-critical fire alarm unit that detects
 * fire emergencies and takes necessary actions to ensure building safety. This component
 * is vital in handling fire incidents and follows safety-critical software standards.
 *
 * Safety-Critical Considerations:
 * 1. Reliability: The program prioritizes reliability by ensuring that alarm triggers,
 *    door operations, and communication with the overseer are robust and dependable.
 *
 * 2. Fault Tolerance: The program includes error handling mechanisms for various scenarios,
 *    such as socket binding failures, TCP connection problems, or invalid datagrams.
 *
 * 3. Minimal Dynamic Memory Usage: To minimize potential memory-related issues, the program
 *    avoids dynamic memory allocation where possible. Fixed-size arrays are used for
 *    shared memory and door storage.
 *
 * 4. Safety Standards: The code adheres to appropriate safety-critical software standards,
 *    and deviations are documented and justified.
 *
 * Deviations and Justifications:
 * - Given the safety-critical nature of the component, a simplified code structure has been
 *   provided. However, complete safety-critical development involves rigorous testing,
 *   formal methods, and strict compliance with established safety standards (e.g., DO-178C for
 *   avionics systems).
 *
 * - Error Handling: The code includes error handling but must undergo extensive testing and
 *   verification to meet the requirements of safety-critical applications fully.
 *
 * - Thorough Testing: Comprehensive testing and validation are essential to ensure the
 *   program's correct operation during fire emergency situations. This is a critical aspect
 *   of safety-critical software development.
 *
 * Note: Safety-critical software often requires more detailed safety documentation and
 * formal verification processes to meet industry-specific standards.
